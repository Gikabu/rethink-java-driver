## Introduction

[Full Documentation, sample code here](http://npiv.github.io/rethink-java-doc/html/)

The Rethink Java Driver aims to be a fully feature complete driver closely mirroring the existing ruby/python/js implementations. Due to limitations of java being a typed language some inspiration will be sought from existing java big data drivers like mongo to make the api as fluent as possible for the end user.

## Milestones

 * complete implementation of all methods in the `python api <http://rethinkdb.com/api/python/>`_
 * complete integration test of all methods. (these should grow together)
 * ORM module 
 * Spring data integration
 * DB connection pooling

## Get involved

Development has only started recently. And whilst the first milestone should be hit within the next 2 weeks, there is still plenty to do. contact me on github, or send me a mail at nick.verlinde on the google mail.
